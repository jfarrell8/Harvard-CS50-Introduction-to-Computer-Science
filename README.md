# Problem Set Coursework for Harvard's CS50: Introduction to Computer Science on edx.org

# OVERVIEW
I audited this course through Harvard in September 2019 to gauge my interest around diving back into some basic computer science coursework. Each week was a different topic/programming concept followed by a problem set that needed to be completed. Below is the course syllabus:

Week 0: Scratch 
Week 1: C
Week 2: Arrays
Week 3: Algorithms
Week 4: Memory
Week 5: Data Structures
Week 6: Python
Week 7: SQL

In this repository, each folder corresponds to the problem set work I completed for each week.
